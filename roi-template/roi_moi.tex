\section{Elicitation of customer goals}
Our customers are the CEO and IT manager of Investment Corp. They desire an easy-to-use application to keep track of their return on their investments (ROI). A requirements elicitation session with our customers yielded the following issues and goals:

Each month, the customer receives a portfolio statement. The customer is not interested in keeping track of individual stocks, bonds etc. in their portfolio. What they would like to know is how the fund is doing thus far, i.e. over all data as well as over a specified evaluation period. There are free applications such as GnuCash for calculating ROI, but such applications require too much input information and are too complex for what is required. Customers also want to compare their return on their investment portfolios with respect to standard benchmarks \cite{gips,Lawton09}. Benchmark data (when available) is either at year-end or year-to-date.

Customers might have multiple portfolios e.g. one for themselves and one for their spouse. All returns on investments are expressed in percentage per annun and all calculations must be done to industry standards. Customers might enter deposits into the investment account at arbitrary dates during the year. They may also withdraw money at arbitrary dates. This will affect the ROI calculation.

The input data for each portfolio is maintained by the customer as a CSV (comma separated value) text file as in Fig.~\ref{fig:csv}. This allows them to keep track of their data on their smart phones or other devices. On the Windows desktop, double clicking on the file opens in Excel as in in the figure. The input also reports agent fees and, possibly a benchmark. For market values, cash flow (positive in, negative out) and agent fees, where no value is shown the default is zero.

Customers receive statements (sometimes monthly or every couple of months and always at the end of each year â€“ Dec. 31) from their investment brokers. The statement has a bottom line viz. the total value of all their investments to date (which includes bonds, stocks, etc.). Customers enter the total value of their portfolio at that date. For example, customers might receive a statement dated December 31, 2006 for \$10,000. This is the value of the portfolio at the end of December 31, 2007, and is entered as \$10,000 dated January 1, 2007. All entries thus reflect the value of the portfolio at the beginning of the day with deposits and withdrawals occurring during the rest of the day.

Customers do not want to pay a lot of money for the software and so they are prepared to forgo many things --- a minimalistic product is expected. The product may be used via a command line interface (it may also have a simple GUI or can be mounted as a properly secured web application).

\hline
R1 & All return on investment calculations shall follow the GIPS standard. & \\

\hline
R2 & The user shall be provided with the annual compounded TWR for the evaluation period start to end, provided that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The optional evaluation period is in range (see Invariant 1).
\item If no evaluation period is provided then the start date is the earliest date and the end date the latest date in the sequence of tuple data.
\item Every data tuple (row in the CSV file) has a date and a non-negative market value (Invariant 2).
\item Dates in the tuples are unique and ordered (see Invariant 3).
\item No withdrawal in the tuple data can be greater than the market value (Invariant 4).
\item An account cannot grow from zero market value and cash flow (Invariant 5).
\item For each tuple, the market value plus cash-flow must be non-zero (see third precondition of feature twr).
\end{enumerate}
& See invariants of TWR\_CALCULATION in Figure 5 TWR\_CALCULATION. See feature annual\_coumpounded\_TWR in TWR\_CALCULATION.\\

\hline
R3 & If the evaluation period is less than a year, then the TWR shall be reported in absolute terms as a percentage return (e.e. it is not annualized). If the evaluation period is a year or more, then the TWR is annualized to a percentage per year. & See postcondition of annual\_compounded\_TWR \\

\hline
R4 & The annualized TWR shall be reported as a percentage. & \\

\hline
R5 & Agent fees are treated like a deposit. & \\

\hline
R6 & The benchmark shall be reported as a compounded TWR if the benchmark figures are available for the evaluation period. & \\

\hline
R7 & Error messages: If any of the conditions mentioned in requirement R2 do not hold then an appropriate error message shall be displayed to the user. & Invariants and preconditions in TWR\_CALCULATION provide error conditions.\\




\hline
\end{tabular}

{\color{red} Note that you must calculate the compounded TWR (and its annualized value) for the complete period as well as for the evaluation period. The TWR is not always accurate. You must provide an accurate calculation (called precise-ROI).}

\section{Mathematical model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

{\color{red} We provide below an incomplete mathematical model for ROI system. We define a valid input CSV file as a regular expression. Obviously there must be an error report for files that do not match the precise specification of input. We also provide the outline of a type to calculate the TWR and precise-ROI, which you must complete. You will also need a function table to ensure that all possible inputs (including faulty inputs) are handled.}

\section{REGEXP}

\begin{figure}
\input{inputs/regexp}
\caption{Type REGEXP for regular expressions over printing characters}
\end{figure}

A set of strings is used as the model for regular expressions. We use prefix operators for the Kleene closure (e.g. $*x$ where $x$ is a regular expression such as $\{\squote{hello}\}$) and iteration at least one or more (e.g. $\textrm{+}x$) rather than suffix operators. Note that where there is no confusion we use \squote{hello} instead of $\{\squote{hello}\}$ where the set is a singleton. 

We may use type REGEXP to specify a $FLOAT\_STRING$ as follows.

\begin{align}
FLOAT\_STRING = &\squote{+}Inf\\
&|\squote{-}Inf\\
&|NaN\\
&|(\squote{-}|\squote{+}|\epsilon)\cdot(^*d\cdot\squote{.}|\epsilon)\cdot
	^*\!\!d\cdot ((\squote{e}\cdot(\squote{-}|\epsilon)\cdot^\textrm{+}d)\,|\,\epsilon)\\
d = &\squote{0} | \squote{1} | \cdots |\squote{9} 
\end{align}

In the above we use the convention that \squote{e}, for example, really stands for the single set $\{\squote{e}\}$.

\section{Precise calculation of ROI}

The TWR is only an approximation to the real time-weighted return, as in  Fig.~\ref{fig:twr} (where one can see that the infusion of \$500 in cash reduces the ROI). 

Fig.~\ref{fig:bad-twr} shows where the approximation goes badly wrong. In this case, the investment advisor made a huge profit for our client and the gain is 16.19\%, whereas the TWR shows the advisor as making a loss of 5.58\%.

Clearly, a more precise method is called for. 



\begin{figure}[!]

\includegraphics[scale=2.3]{inputs/bad-twr.png}
\caption{TWR as a bad approximation}
\label{fig:bad-twr}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Compound interest}
Suppose you invest \$1000 for 5 years at 10\% per annum. So we know that after the first year we have $1000*R = 1000*1.10 = 1100$ (where $R$ is the rate of return multiplier, i.e. $R=1.1$). For 5 years we have $1000*R^5 = 1610.51$. The general formula is

\[ PV * (1+r)^n = FV\]

\noindent where $r$ is the interest rate as a decimal (e.g. 0.1, i.e. 10\%), and $n$ is the number of periods. If $R=1+r$ then we have $PV * R^n = FV$


For the second example in Fig.~\ref{fig:twr}, it is not so simple as we are not adding amounts at regular intervals (cash flow in/out is irregular). We may use $n$ as a day (i.e. $1/365$ of a year) and we get:

\[
FV = (PV *R^{365/365}) + (500*R^{116/365})
\]

i.e. we weight the initial money ($PV = 10000$) by the full year (365 days) of daily return. The input of cash in Septmember (which is 116 days to the end of the years) is weighted in that proportion. The equation van be re-written

\[
(PV *R^{365/365}) + (500*R^{116/365}) -FV = 0
\]

and we can solve for the root of the polynomial (e.g. using Newton-Raphson) to obtain $R$. This gives us a net gain of $4.923$\%. The TWR calculated it as $5$\%, which is only approximately correct.

The general formulas is
\begin{align}
\small
& tr(1).mv * R^{\Delta days(i)} + \\\nonumber
& \qquad (\Sigma i: \nat|1 < i < n\itholds tr(i).cf * R^{\Delta days(i)})- tr(n).mv = 0\\
& \textbf{where } n = \card(tr)& \nonumber \\
& end = tr(n).date&\\\nonumber
&\Delta days(i) = (end- tr(i).date)/365&\nonumber
\end{align}

\end{document}
